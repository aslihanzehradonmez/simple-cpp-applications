## 🌟 Application Descriptions

### ✅ Calculator 🧮  
An advanced command-line calculator supporting full arithmetic expressions, parentheses, trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithms, square roots, and history tracking with `ans` keyword support.

### ✅ GPA Calculator 🎓  
Calculates GPA based on entered courses, credits, and letter grades. Includes grade validation, classification (Honors, Pass, etc.), data persistence via text files, and color-coded output.

### ✅ ATM Simulation 🏦  
A multi-user ATM simulation featuring encrypted file-based storage, PIN-based login, deposit, withdrawal, balance inquiry, and full transaction history. Offers a complete CLI banking experience.

### ✅ Number Guessing Game 🎯  
Guess a secret number based on chosen difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard, or Random). Tracks attempts and duration. Features leaderboards by difficulty, name input, and performance sorting.

### ✅ Fibonacci & Factorial Calculator 🐑  
Displays a table of Fibonacci and factorial values up to a user-defined number. Includes color-coded overflow detection and formatted CLI output for mathematical visualization.

### ✅ File Reading & Writing App 📂  
A complete file manager on the terminal. Offers reading, writing, analyzing, copying, deleting, renaming files, and viewing directory content and file properties. Windows-specific enhancements included.

### ✅ Prime Number Finder 🔍  
Finds all prime numbers within a given range entered by the user, checks if a number is prime, finds the first N primes, and performs prime factorization. Great for learning loops, conditions, and efficiency techniques.

### ✅ Grade Calculator 📝  
Accepts midterm and final exam scores, computes a weighted average, assigns a letter grade, and optionally handles multiple subjects and class-wide averages.

### ✅ Caesar Cipher 🔐  
A simple encryption app supporting Caesar, Vigenère, and Transposition ciphers. Users can encode or decode messages interactively.

### ✅ User Login System 👤  
A basic CLI login system with registration, login, and session support. Passwords are hashed and stored in a file. Includes color-coded prompts and hidden password input for Windows.
